# string-hashing-cpp
This project explores the collision problem in string hashing and its impact on banned domain name detection. In many applications, such as spam filters and security systems, it is necessary to maintain a list of banned domain names. However, as the number of banned domain names increases, the performance of the lookup operation becomes a concern.
